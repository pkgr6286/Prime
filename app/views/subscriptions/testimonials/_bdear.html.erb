  <p>There are a lot of training solutions out there, but <strong>Upcase is led by thoughtbot, so I know the stuff we're learning is the absolute best of the best practices</strong>. When I'm teaching junior devs, there's often a lot of conflicting information out there on how to do something, so Upcase helps me establish "better" best practices.</p>
